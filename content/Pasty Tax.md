UK Govt wanted to raise Â£110mn income by adding 20% tax to hot takeout goods in 2012. (They did not do it after backlash)

This would have lead to businesses adding 20% to the price or to wait for them to cool down and serve them cold as doing so could make them exempt from VAT. (Worse for the consumer both ways)

Cold pasties would be taxed at the lower rate as it was argued they are for consumption at home which is charged at 0%

# Description
• Standing, flex your toes (of one foot) upward and place them against the wall, keeping the rest of that same foot on the floor.  
• Lean the upper part of your body towards the wall, while gently raising your heel off from the floor. If you are doing this right, it will feel as though your toes are pushing into the wall and you will feel a pull and slight discomfort.  
• Hold this position for 3-5 seconds, and then slowly go back to the starting position.  
• Repeat these steps about 10 times with one foot, and then switch to repeat them with your other foot.

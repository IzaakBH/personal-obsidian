# Is capital taxation bad?
The [[Adam Smith Institute]] argues that all capital taxation is bad because it "taxes future consumption higher than current consumption, incentivising short-termism"

With a 5% interest rate, £100 of consumption now is worth £162.29 of consumption later. (See [[Compound Interest]])

Assuming a flax 20% tax on all earnings & 5% interest rates. Earning £125 leaves you with £100 to spend or save. Saving £50 you would end up with £81.44 over 10 years. But you'd have to pay 20% of your interest income each year in tax. Leaving you with £74.01; £7.43 or 9.12% worse off. This is the equivalent of a 1% drop in interest per year.

The 1% difference is much larger over 30 or 40 years. Over 30 years, that 1% would give leave you 33% better off. This means a flat 20% tax on all earnings is a **33% tax on consumption in 30 years time**
## My Opinion
Yes, on the working classes this is bad. But for people and companies with large coffers, we should be encouraging them to spend money. There is massive hoarding of wealth and we need to incentivise this money to be redistributed naturally. 

Taxation on saving earnings above £500 is bad, but earnings above maybe £10k may be a better level.

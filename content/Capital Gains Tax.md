Capital gains tax is applied on investment gains at the point of realising those gains.

CGT has sat between 18 & 40% since 1978. Pre the 62, there were no capital gains.
CGT accounts for approx .4% of treasury income in 2020[^1], making it quite insignificant compared to other forms of taxation.

Capital gains are mainly received by the wealthy.

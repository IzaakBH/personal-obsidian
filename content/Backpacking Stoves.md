A stove (and pan) that connects to a small burner for cooking when hiking.

# Dealing with Wind (Fuel Type)
Wind can make gas stoves hard to use and slow to heat. A wind guard can be used but is a pain according to some.

# Things to consider
- A regulator is nice to allow you to preserve fuel and cooking temp.
- Titanium pots are not great conductors, stir regularly and use lower heat.

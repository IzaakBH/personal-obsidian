A gap between income and CGT can be seen as inequitable. Particularly when we compare total income tax including NI etc with CGT.

[[Capital Gains Tax]] is set a 20% in the UK.
[[Dividends]] are taxed at up to 39.35%.

# Dividends vs CGT
The gap incentivises tax avoidance by preferring increasing share prices and selling them to realise gains. This also incentivises businesses to engage in negative practices such as chasing share price and performing share buybacks.

The UK is an anomaly in some regards but not in others. [^1]

# Income tax vs CGT
Looking at the below graph, equalising CGT and income tax would make the UK a significant outlier in that we would have the highest CGT in the developed world.

There is an argument that this is not a good idea, but this does not mean we cannot push the needle in the right direction.

# Effects
The large cap creates a string incentive to convert income to capital gains.
As there is no allowance in CGT for inflation, investors are taxed on an income that may not be real when inflation is taken into account. 

# Inequity
As CGT is mainly the reserve of the wealthy, taxing it less than income disproportionately
benefits the rich.
Half of all CGT is by 5000 people[^2]

# Reform Suggestions
**Equalise income tax and CGT**
Set both at around 30%. It would be seen by many as a tax cut for the rich, and that would probably be correct because it may be that the revenue gains from increasing the rate of CGT would be smaller than the revenue losses from reducing dividend tax.[^1]
**Do not tax inflationary CGT**
Incentivises investment by ensuring only real capital gains are taxed.

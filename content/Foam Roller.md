# Description
- Make sure to roll the full length of the muscle
- Avoid strong pressure over bony points - this can just bruise tendons.
- Comfortably uncomfortable - no brusing.
- Roll 2-3 times a week.
## Areas to Roll
### [[Quadriceps]]
Useful for someone with a day job.
Lie face down on the roller and roll the upper leg.
### [[Hip Flexor]]
Also useful for someone who sits a lot.
Lay face down and roll the top of the upper leg.
### [[Calves]]
Face up, support your bum off the ground and roll the length of the lower leg.
### [[Hamstrings]]
Same setup as calves, but roll the length of the upper leg.
### [[IT Band]]
Side Plank atop the roller. Roll along the upper leg on the side.
### Upper Back
Lie on the roller across the whole back, bum off the ground. Rock back and forth from the shoulders to mid back.
### Lats
Lie on your side. Put the roller under your armpit. One arm extended out and the other on the floor for support.

[Running fast and injury free](http://www.scribd.com/doc/18228/Gordon-Piries-Running-Fast-and-Injury-Free-ultimate-edition-240307)

- Running shoes encourage a heel strike instead of a mid/forefoot strike. This results in higher impact through the knees. They desensitise the feet from the ground due to the padding (Why is this bad?)

# Transitioning
Barefoot running requires calf and foot strength that will previously have been missing.

1) Walking barefoot (Done)
2) Stretching and Mobility
3) Foot strength training
4) Learn correct [[Running Technique]]
5) Very low volume (half mile start)

Sore calf muscles and arches are expected when starting.

## Stretches & Exercises
- [[Ankle Pump]]
- [[Sitting Hamstring Stretches]] - Pulling the foot forward 
- [[Seated Leg Stretch]] - Pulling feet forwards
- [[Short Foot]]
- [[Toe Spacers]]
- [[Toe-ga]]
- [[Calf Raises]]
- Balancing on one leg
- [[Primal Squat]]
- [[100Up]]

# Common Injury
- [[ Achilles Tendonitis]]
Attributed to heel rise on normal shoes making it weaker and less flexible & the required adaptation to no drop.

- Top of foot pain
Number of causes...
- Over striding (feet not landing under center of gravity)
Striking under center of gravity reduces impact force 
- Not bringing heel down when striking
Practice a softer landing and bringing the heel down to reduce impact

An [[Overuse Injury]] of the [[IT Band]].
# Symptoms
- Pain on the outside of the knee, increasing as someone performs repetitive bending and straightening (flexion and extension) of the knee. (1)
- A clicking, popping or snapping on the outside of the knee. (1)
- Excessive internal leg rotation (leg turns in too much when stepping or landing) - i have seen this when doing pistols and going too low (2)
# Causes
Controversial.
- Some think it is caused by friction of repeated flexion and extension leading to inflammation of the area under the IT band.
- Some think it is the result of compressive forces to a fat pad deep to the IT band (what does this mean?)
- Some think chronic inflammation of the IT band [[Bursa]]

# Factors
## Individual Factors
- Anatomy
	- variations in anatomy (hip and knee alignment)
	- Excessive foot [[Pronation]]
- Flexibility
	- Lack of flexibility in some muscle groups (which?) can affect the way things move.
- Muscle Strength
	- Imbalances in the pelvis, hip, knees, foot and ankle can lead to faulty movement patters and strain the IT band.
- Muscle Control
	- Decreased muscle coordination and control of the leg can lead to decreased alignment and increased tension and stress at the knee.

## Training Factors
- Training surface
	- Training on tilted surfaces or repeated downhill running (not relevant for me)
- Training Dosage
	- Sudden increase in volume/intensity can increase stress and cause faulty movement patterns.
- Shoe wear
	- Probably more relevant for runners.

# Diagnosis
Talk to a sports medicine physician, [[physiatrist]] or [[PT]].
(1)
# Treatment
- Rest followed by consultation with a [[PT]].
- Proper bike fit
Treatment depends very much on the cause, hence why it is best for the PT to identify that to create a plan.
## Stretches & Exercises
Initial workouts
- [[Glute]]
	- These help stabilise the pelvis, stopping it dropping to one side. 
- [[Foot]]
	- Aim to strengthen the arch and the [[Tibialis Posterior]].
- [[Quadriceps]]
- [[Hamstrings]]
- [[Foam Roller]] on the side of the [[Thigh]]
Once the knee pain settles, more strenuous exercises like...
- [[Lunges]]
- [[Squat]]
- [[Balancing on one leg]]
- [[Pistol Squat]]
- [[Box Jumps]]
# Prevention
Correcting risk factors/training errors that caused the error (duh).
Flexibility, strength training & gaining control at the pelvis, hips, knees, foot and ankle. (how?)

# Description
A strong & flexible connective tissue that protects joints and bones.

Made out of cells called [[chondrocytes]]. These are different than normal cells.

There are no blood vessels in cartilage to provide nutrients. Instead nutrients diffuse through a dense connective tissue surrounding the cartilage (called the perichondrium).
Because of this alternate method of nutrient supply, cartilage grows slower than other tissues.

> Bad news: Cartilage grows slower than other tissues, so this will take a long time!

# Role
Provides shock absorption and smooth movements of the joints.

# Rehab
Cartilage is influenced by activity. It can be influenced in an anabolic (positive) or catabolic (negative) way.

**Low intensity & Impact**: To keep the pressure on the cartilage low to reduce the damage done.

**10-15 mins is ideal**: after this time, the [[chondrocytes]] "shut down" and there is no more benefit to be had.

**Cyclic** motion is ideal. This is regular motion in which the cartilage slides past each other with a relatively consistent pressure.

**4-12 hrs rest**: between exercises (dependant on exercise) to allow ample time to recover. 
## Good Exercises for Knee Cartilage 
- Cycling - 60-70 spm, 4-8 hrs interval
- Cross trainer - 60-70 spm, 4-8 hrs interval
- Rowing machine - 20-30 spm, 4-8 hrs interval
- Leg press machine - 20-30 rpm, moderate resistance, 6-12 hrs interval.
## Bad Exercises for Knee Cartilage
- Running
- Jumping

Whilst these exercises are not great for cartilage due to being high impact, they are good for strengthening the [[subchondral bone plate]]. Strengthening this makes you more able to do more intense impact sports.

## Plan
1) Do cartilage friendly exercises only 
2) Introduce some high intensity walking and strength training - this is to help strengthen the [[subchondral bone plate]]
3) Running & other higher impact sports.
## Supplements
Evidence exists that the below supplements can aid cartilage growth.

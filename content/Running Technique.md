Essential to reduce injury when barefoot running.
# Description
Correct running technique is key to reducing injury. With correct form, running can aid in repairing and strengthening your knees, feet, ankles and hips.

- Land gently and with control. Do not smash into the floors
- Land on the forefoot, instead of the knee.
	- This activates more muscles. It will be particularly strenuous on the knees when you start.
	- Make your strides smaller. This will help keep the foot under your knee and make a forefoot strike easier.
- Slightly lean forwards when running. This aids you with striking on the forefoot. It also allows you to maintain motion by "falling" into the next step.
# How to practice?
- Core exercises
- Do stretches to help with leg flexibility [[Knees Over Toes]]
- Start off very low intensity and length. Increase by 10% max each week only if you feel good.

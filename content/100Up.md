## Minor
- Stand tall with elbows bent as if to be running
- Focus on one leg, drive knee up to hip height (this is important) while driving the same side elbow back
- Return foot same start position (this is also important) and bring elbow forward
- Repeat on the same side for 10-20 or even 30 repetitions and then repeat on the side

## Major
- Assume start position outlined in step one of the “minor”. Alternately you can perform this in the field without alignment cues.
- Push off from the greater toe and drive knee to hip height
- As you return ball of foot to start position begin driving off the ball of the opposite foot
- You should feel as though you are running in place on the balls of your feet
- Remember your knee must drive to hip height and arm swing is in concert with the leg movement

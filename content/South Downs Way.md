# Summary
Suggested as a 9 day route (13 miles a day) [^1] along the south east cost of England.
# Location
100 miles from Winchester to Eastbourne with decent elevation. The ground is said to be quite hard and quick drying due to being on chalk.

# Resupplies
Upper Beeding is said to be one place close to the trail with a shop.

# Camping
Some good spots are mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKhiking/comments/u3os8x/anyone_done_the_south_downs_way/), but some say that due to the open nature and proximity to civilisation, you may struggle unless pitching up very late.

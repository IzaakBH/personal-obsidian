Using Envelope Budgeting. As soon as money comes in, it is separated into pots with a given function. Pots may not be spent for a given month, but once a year. Money can be transferred between pots.

Allows for averaging of expenses over months
Allows for flexibility for unbudgeted expenses

Very granular budgets to have best overview of where money is going.

## Representing in Moneybox

For non regular spending, like clothes, the transfer into a savings pot should be marked as that category. Any spending that month that goes above the total in the pot should be marked as additional spending.

For regular spending, or where the pot only has one months contributions, the savings transfer can be marked as a regular transaction and the individual spends put in that category. 

Alternatively to the above, could mark the transfer as the category and split the txn to match whatever is spent in the category, experiment with these.

# Long term goals
Australia - around 10k is ideal for a full year. Working/Volunteering can help to stretch this further. Initial calculations could leave me with 16-20k if I count two years of saving 300/month plus the credit card stoozed savings.

# PSA
Higher rate payers get £500/year tax free interest. My stoozing will beat this in 2024 tax year, hence all other savings should be in an ISA this year.
## ISA Rates
To beat an ISA, the regular savings must be 40% more.
To beat regular savings, ISA must be at least 60% of the rate.

| Pre Tax Rate | Post 40% Tax Rate |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| 3            | 1.8               |
| 4            | 2.4               |
| 5            | 3.0               |
| 6            | 3.8               |
| 7            | 4.2               |
| 8            | 4.8               |
| 9            | 5.4               |
# Stoozing
**Note**: new ISA rules (Apr 24) allow contributing to multiple accounts of the same type in one year. This changes the strategy a lot.

# Other Savings
In 24/25 tax year, all cash savings should go in and ISA to avoid tax.

Zopa is my ISA of choice as it allows pots for easy management for a v small (.2% ish) hit.
## Australia
£300/ Month into ISA = £3600/ year

If working until April 2026 we should expect £7500 ISH.
## CC Payments
Approx £300/month paid off balances and will be received at end of cc term. 

Can be used as extra aus savings.
## Investments
Should invest maybe £100 per month. Need to factor this into a budget.

### Wealthify
£250 invested on 10th April with a £50 reward 6 months later.

### Hargreaves Lansdown
£100 invested on 23rd July with a £50 reward 7 months later.

## Historic Investments 
### &Me
£100 reward on may 30th for investing £500 and holding it for a year. Note the £100 has been rewarded but must remain invested till the 30th.

The £650 return went back into vanguard ISA but is part of aus savings.

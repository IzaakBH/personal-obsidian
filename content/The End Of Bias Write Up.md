# Bias
> The individual who acts with bias engages with an expectation instead of reality.

## How is bias built?
Bias is built from "the artifacts of culture". Headlines, history books, myths, statistics, real & imagined encounters as well as **selective encounters of reality that confirm prior belief**.

The final point above is important. When we expect someone or something to behave in a certain way, we perceive their actions in a way that conforms more to that expectation.

# Bias
> The individual who acts with bias engages with an expectation instead of reality.
## How is bias built?
Bias is built from "the artifacts of culture". Headlines, history books, myths, statistics, real & imagined encounters as well as **selective encounters of reality that confirm prior belief**.

The final point above is important. When we expect someone or something to behave in a certain way, we perceive their actions in a way that conforms more to that expectation.

### Associations
We absorb associations from our surroundings and the media we consume. These associations often include biased views.
## How bias manifests?
Bias can manifest in being treated differently.
It can also be in the form of omission. Be that through policy, in social and physical settings. This may be through lack of ramps for people with reduced mobility or through explicit exclusion from circles.

One example is repeated "discoveries" by white scientists that were made decades earlier by black scientists.
## Types of Biases
Below are some of the common biases and examples of how they manifest.
## Gender
- Female students are reprimanded less than male students for the same behaviour.
### Medical
- Women's medical symptoms are taken less seriously.
### Work
- When applying to [[STEM]] roles, women will be seen as less competent and deserving of a lower salary than a man with the same resume.
- Women must be 2.5x as productive as a man to be rated equally compitent.
## Race
- Black students are perceived to be more troublesome than white students who are behaving the same way.
- Sports commentators will be more likely to comment on the mind of white players and the body of black players.
### Work
- White applicants are more likely to get callbacks to jobs.
	- This applies even if the interviewer has seen a "black" name. 
- A white person with a criminal history is more likely to get a callback than a black one without.
- Non-white & male sounding names are less likely to hear back from faculty when applying to grad school.
### Medical
- Latino or black people are less likely to be prescribed opioids because of inaccurate stereotypes that they feel less pain. 
## Age
## Weight
### Academic
- Obese students are perceived to be less academically able by teachers.
## Wealth
### Work
- Typically "rich" hobbies that imply a rich childhood will make you more likley to get a callback from a law firm.
	- Does not apply to women, who will be seen as less committed.
## Sexuality
You are more likely to be denied a home loan if you are not a heterosexual couple.

## Perception of Bias
Perception of bias differs based on your proximity to it. Like in many other areas, such as mastering a skill, a vast history of exposure can lead to [[expertise]].
> [!info] People in the majority are not on the receiving ends of their own actions, thus they are not as aware of the impacts they have.

A white person may notice a racist comment but may miss more subtle behaviours such as shuffling away from a black person.

# Unconscious Bias
A contradiction between a person's values and real world, discriminatory, actions. A difference between how they think and how they act.

Also known as *implicit, unintentional or unexamined bias*. 

This book focuses on how to end unconscious bias.
# Bias in Research
Prejudice research is geared to race and gender bias. There is less on the other categories.

Gender bias research assumes a male/female binary. Mostly on white females
Racial bias studies in the US focuses on bias against black Americans.

A trans man with a masculine appearance already in a position of power can mask their status as trans and avoid such bias. A white and black woman will experience some of the same biases, but the white woman will not be subject to some of the black stereotypes or the specifically black female stereotypes.

> Biases are not additive; they are unique to their intersection. (See [[Intersectionality]])

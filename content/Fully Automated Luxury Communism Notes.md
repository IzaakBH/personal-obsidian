70 - contradiction of capitalism. Willing to reduce human involvement to reduce costs. No longer having any workers with enough money to buy the products. No longer having enough revenue to continue. - this seems to be solved by businesses pivoting to luxury or bare minimum goods and services to cater to the growing poor and Uber wealthy.

71 - ford example of recognising that workers require capital to consume. Understanding a symbiotic traditionally that had been lost today

72 **first distuption** 10000bc when we used horses to build a society of agriculture with surplus and complex societies with hierarchies. Also learned how to breed animals selectively. Lack of concentrated power (energy) makes change slow and susceptible to large pushes back. Clean water like in ainchent Rome not found in Europe till 20th century for example.

72 **second disruption** fossil fuels in 19th century 

76 as horses became obsolete overnight, it is possible the millions of factory workers may also with a significant leap in manufacturing automation. Also possible for it to be a slow decline but viewed as fast in retrospect.

87-88 the argument that new jobs replace the old: 80% of jobs are more than 100 years old. Of the 20% of new jobs 10% of people do one of these. So more, higher skilled jobs are created that employ less people.

101: the sun provides many thousands more times energy than we use & will do so even if our usage increases way above worst case estimates. **The sun can provide virtually limitless energy**

104: moving to renewables is free  : we spend 2.2tn $ a yr on fossil fuels. Cost of moving is 1.9tn a yr for 40 years.

107: Nigeria only has 50% ppl with elec. By going straight to solar, it saves on making a national grid (solar per village etc) and is green AF

108: 90% of Africans own a phone. They skipped landlines and went str8 to phones.

115 116 in capitalism price must equal marginal cost for something to be made (there must be profit.) as we move past scarcity we then see existing powers trying to limit how the new tech is available to maintain scarcity. They also change the ownership model to subscriptions to extract rent for things that are now abundant.

118 peak copper & other minerals critical for tech is meant to be around 2050. Recycling is not yet prevalent enough.

118 we are running out of phosphorus for fertiliser

120 scarcity would still cause conflict

120 mining asteroids will solve scarcity

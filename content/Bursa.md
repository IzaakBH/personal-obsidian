Bursa/bursas/bursae are lubricated fluid-filled semi-permeable thin sacs located...
- between [[Bones]] and soft tissue
- between bones and [[Tendons]]
- between muscles around joints (1)

They reduce tension and negative effects of wear and tear at points of friction.

They provide resistance free movement.

They contain [[Synovial]] fluid comparable to the consistency of raw egg whites.
# Injury
Injury to bursa allows fluid such as blood can fill the sac and cause injury.

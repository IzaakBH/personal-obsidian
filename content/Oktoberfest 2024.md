Izaak, James, Connor, Tarun, Dec & Lucy (6)
# Oktoberfest
Some things about what it is, how to do it etc here.
# Travel
## Trains
Seem to be around £250 returns
## Flights
Direct London to Munich costs around £250 -> £400 return. This is too much for me.

London -> Frankfurt costs £50-100 & Return train Frankfurt to Munich costs around £70 making a total of £120-170 return. This is more acceptable for me.

# Accommodation
**TLDR**: I prefer hostel as its closer & cheaper (or similar price) and we still get a private ensuite.
Note that Munich has an extensive public transport network so it may be possible to stay somewhere further out to save significantly. This depends on the operating hours.

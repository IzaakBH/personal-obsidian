# Description
- Sit in a comfortable chair, placing your feet flat on the floor, with knees at a 90Â° angle, and back straight for comfort and support.
- Slowly curl the toes of both feet under, as much as possible. This will cause the ball of each foot to slightly lift from the floor.
- Hold this position for 3-5 seconds, and then slowly release the curl back to the flat position.
- Repeat this 10 times.

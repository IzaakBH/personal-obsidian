# Description
A tax at the point of purchase for consumers. A tax on consumption.

# UK Specifics
Earned the UK around £120bn in 2016-17, around 22% of all tax[^1].
## Areas Taxed
- 5% on household gas and electricity bills
	- Arguments that this is harsh on the poor as they spend a higher portion of their income here so the tax impacts them more.
	- Scrapping is inefficient as a poor person may save £20 a year in vat but the rich saves £70, meaning we subsidise the rich more. 
- 0% on foods bought to eat or cook at home
- 20% on food consumed in a restaurant, and hot take-away food or drink
## VAT Threshold
The VAT threshold is £85k turnover a year. Below this threshold, businesses do not have to report VAT. This makes the product cheaper to the end consumer, as the VAT is not added to the cost of goods & services. Above and they must register for VAT, incurring a tax bill of £17,000 minus any VAT reclaimed on input.

This cliff leads to businesses clumping around that turnover. Earning an extra £1 can cost businesses thousands in the bill and extra admin.

In order to keep turnover low. Businesses may...
1) Under-report earnings
2) Refuse extra work - not take on apprentices, leaving businesses at 1 employee
3) Take longer holidays.
Points 2 & 3 have implications from a productivity point of view.

### Examples
- Uber Drivers
	- Most earn sub £85k, meaning there is no VAT on their portion of the fare, only on Uber's cut.
	- A competing firm in which drivers are employed by the company directly would likely have to add VAT to the whole of the fare, making it more expensive and less competitive.
### Solutions
**Lower VAT reporting threshold**
- Lower to around 10k (EU minimum)
Pros: 
- Mostly solves the bunching problem as it is not realistic for all but micro businesses to reduce income to avoid VAT.
- Raises £2bn for the treasury (Tiny amount)
Cons: More admin and costs for small business
- Could be mitigated by allowing small business to use the [[#VAT Flat Rate Scheme]]
**Raise the VAT reporting threshold**
Pros:
- Could be argued once businesses scale more they will be more willing to take the leap.
Cons: 
- Kicks the can down the road to a higher bracket. 
- Costs the treasury a lot in businesses no longer paying (if this is income lost from small businesses this might not be such a bad thing)
**Freeze the threshold**
Pros: 
- Over time, this will cause an effective drop
Cons:
- We don't fix the threshold problem for 20 years
**Stepped system**[^3]
At 30k, VAT is 1% with 1% recoverable. Up to £140k where it is 20/20.
Once impractical, but as we move to a digital world, this becomes easier.
1) Delete the tax
## VAT Exemptions
Certain goods and sectors are exempt from VAT. This makes life harder for all VAT registered businesses and discourages trade. (See [[#VAT Threshold]]). 

Impacts
- Nudging consumer behaviour as some goods are exempt therefore cheaper.
- Nudging investment behaviour within the same sector (E-Cigs taxed higher than Nicotine gum making them less attractive for investment (this is probably not a bad thing but not for the treasury to decide))
- Wasted effort, money & court time on legal battles to reclassify foods in order to get lower VAT rates. (See [[Jaffa Cake Case]])

Examples
- [[Jaffa Cake Case]] - Reclassifying foods to lower VAT
- [[Pasty Tax]] - Lowering the quality of goods to save tax

Reform Suggestions
Replace all exemptions with a flat rate. This increases VAT earnings. Increase the PSA to reduce the impact on poorer people.
Increase means tested benefits such as [[Working Tax Credits]].
The above could still raise extra income for the treasury to be used elsewhere.[^2]
## VAT Flat Rate Scheme
Eliminates the need to claim and register every purchase and instead estimates a flat rate on your total turnover based on the industry you are in.
- A corner shop owner with lots of input costs will pay a flat 4% rate as they would likely be claiming a lot back, reducing their effective rate
- An IT consultant with few input costs will pay 14.5%.

# Summary
> Fairly easy walking through woods, over chalk grassland, minor roads and, especially in Kent, through orchards and farmland. [^1]

It follows much of the same path as the [[North Downs Way]].

Struggled to find free resources, but there is a book costing Â£12 new on amazon that should have all the details of the route.
# Location
138 miles from Winchester -> Canterbury

# Travel
Trains are too long and will be too expensive

Flights are looking Â£150-250 direct from London. These should be booked ASAP as prices will only go higher, even this far out.

MCR is much cheaper

Take a look again in month of august to ensure all routes are published
# Accommodation
Will stay in a hostel in Athens. These are not yet available for booking in many places.

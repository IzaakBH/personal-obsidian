# Description
Rolling a hockey/tennis ball under your foot.
# Rationale
Aims to massage the [[Planar Fascia]] underneath the foot. Doing so is said to help "relax" it and release stiffness. It is also said to help with soreness and get you used to pain in the foot.

Need to do more research. Does it actually make a difference, is it temporary or a placebo?

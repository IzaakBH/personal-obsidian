A more accurate view of the tax a person pays. It looks at the taxation on an extra Â£1 of income. It considers direct taxation such as [[Income Tax]], but also indirect impacts such as the withdrawal of [[Means Tested]] [[Benefits]]. 

Some believe that a high marginal effective tax rate disincentivises work. I don't quite follow this. At the lower levels, yes, this is bad. If we have tradies not taking on extra work they would like to do then we should be lowering their taxation. But often this is also applied to high earners in sectors that do not provide a useful service to average people, such as banking executives. 

Another argument against the above is that if jobs are meaningful and rewarding enough then the extra income will not be the main motivator. People wants jobs they enjoy.
